### Hi there, my name is Bruno and I am from EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on an open-source Costumer Relationship Management software, also known as a CRM
- ðŸŒ± I am also currently taking an electrical engineering course at the [Federal University of the State of EspÃ­rito Santo](http://ufes.br/) in Brazil
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on whatever I can (I really do enjoy being productive)
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with the afore mentioned project as it is quite a complex piece of software
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything honestly, though I wonder what you would want to know
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at [bruno.blanes@outlook.com](mailto:bruno.blanes@outlook.com) or via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/BrunoBlanes/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really can not distinguish between sarcasm, irony and the truth, so please be careful with words ðŸ’š
